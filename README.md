# dma-28-interactivity-projects
**Spring 2009 D|MA-28 Interactivity I Class Projects**

Processing projects produced for a college [D|MA Interactivity Class](http://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Spring09/28/) -- my first introduction to programming.

# Projects
## [Abstract Art](/AbstractVector)
![abstract-vector](/docs/abstract-vector.png)

Recreate a section of a piece of abstract art using the vector drawing functions within Processing.

The process more or less involved creating the image in Illustrator and copying the anchor values into the program.

## [Music Sketch](/MusicSketch)
![abstract-vector](/docs/music-sketch.png)

Generate a static, abstract image inspired by a song of choice.

I chose Tenacious D's "Friendship".

## [Drawing Program](/DripLine)
![drawing](/docs/dripline-drawing.png)

Create a mouse-drawing application.

## [Alphabet Project](/AlphabetPong)
![alphabet](/docs/alphabet-pong.png)

Create a a sketch with interactions for each letter of the alphabet.

I created a "pong" variant to begin understanding how the manage the lifecycle of a game.

## [Midterm](/Midterm/SideScroller)
![side-scroller](/docs/side-scroller.png)

Create a narrative.

An opportunity to understand how side-scrolling games are made, including levels, checkpoints, pickups, enemies, and a boss.

## [Square Pet](/SquarePet)
![sqare](/docs/emotional-square.png)

Imbue a square with emotion.

Play with and feed your new square pet! The quivering only means it's having fun.

## [Final Game](/SheepHerding)
![Game](/docs/sheep-2.png)

Make a game.

I chose a project that allowed me to explore modeling a system with more complex behavior! Here the sheep will wander and flock together over time, but scatter and wander aimlessly for a bit if the dog gets too close.
